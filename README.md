### Installation on MacOS:

1. **Homebrew** (Recommended):
    - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you haven't already (it's a package manager for macOS).
    - Open a terminal and run:
      ```
      $ brew install python
      ```
    - Homebrew packages are usually up-to-date, and upgrading is straightforward.

2. **Official Installer**:
    - If you're not comfortable with the command line, use the official installer:
      - Download it from the [Python download website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Python on Linux:

1. **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**:
    - If you're familiar with WSL, consider this option.
    - Install WSL (preferably WSL2).
    - Follow the Linux installation instructions below.

2. **Linux**:
    - Use your package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, or `pacman`) to install Python.
    - For example, on Ubuntu:
      ```
      $ sudo apt update
      $ sudo apt install python3
