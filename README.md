## How to run the application locally
### STEP 1: Install Python on your system.

### Install Python on Windows:

1. **Using the Microsoft Store**:
    - Open the Microsoft Store.
    - Search for "Python."
    - Choose the newest version and install it. This method handles updates automatically and allows easy uninstallation.

2. **With the Official Installer**:
    - Download the Python installer from the [official Python download website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
    - During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."

### Installation on MacOS:

1. **Homebrew** (Recommended):
    - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you haven't already (it's a package manager for macOS).
    - Open a terminal and run:
      ```
      $ brew install python
      ```
    - Homebrew packages are usually up-to-date, and upgrading is straightforward.

2. **Official Installer**:
    - If you're not comfortable with the command line, use the official installer:
      - Download it from the [Python download website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Python on Linux:

1. **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**:
    - If you're familiar with WSL, consider this option.
    - Install WSL (preferably WSL2).
    - Follow the Linux installation instructions below.

2. **Linux**:
    - Use your package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, or `pacman`) to install Python.
    - For example, on Ubuntu:
      ```
      $ sudo apt update
      $ sudo apt install python3
      ```

## STEP 2: Run the application using python.
